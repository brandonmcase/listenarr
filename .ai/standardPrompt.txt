Before you start, fully read and understand /ai/CodingBestPractices.md and ensure your work aligns.

Next read all the *.md files in /.ai to get context.

Start by updating or creating any planning docs.

When done with each thing, update any docs needed then give recommended next steps

Current TODOs:
- just build out this application, only stop to ask me questions
